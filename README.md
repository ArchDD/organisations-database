#CodeHub Organisations Database project

## Getting started

* You'll need a recent copy of node from: https://nodejs.org/
* Run: `npm install` to install dependencies.
* Run: `npm start` to run the app and view it on http://localhost:3000

**Recent updates**

We are now refactoring the project to use Redux.

You can run the tests with the following command: 
* `npm test` runs the mocha tests

Todo:
- Make the tests pass!

Help:
- The app is currently very similar to the todomvc example: https://github.com/reactjs/redux/tree/master/examples/todomvc
